# COLLATZ_CONJECTURE
The collatz conjecture problem was proposed by Lother Collatz in 1937.
It is easy to understand this problem but it has not been prove yet.The problem is true for almost all the numbers .
The problem states that any natural number x will return to 1 or the sequence ends up with 1 after the computation.If the number is even then divide it by 2,i.e(x/2) if number is odd then add one to it and multiply it by 3,i.e(3*x+1).
The steps are fluctuating above 100 and below 40.
